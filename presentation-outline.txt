# Mastering Claude AI in Development (20 minutes)

## 1. Opening (2-3 minutes)
- Introduction
- The "strawberry" example
  - Demonstrates Claude is a statistical model
  - Sets expectations about AI capabilities
- Common AI assistant frustrations
  - Incomplete answers
  - Assumptions without context
  - The answer merry-go-round

## 2. Main Point: The Power of Clarifying Questions (8-10 minutes)
- Before/After Examples:
  a. Array Manipulation
     - Without: Basic filter/map solution
     - With: Robust, type-safe, error-handled solution
  
  b. React Query Setup
     - Without: Basic query implementation
     - With: Complete solution with error handling, types, and caching strategy
  
  c. Unit Test Creation
     - Without: Basic test structure
     - With: Comprehensive test suite with edge cases
     
- Claude's Self-Analysis
  - Response patterns with/without clarifying questions
  - Impact on solution quality

## 3. Supporting Points (5-7 minutes)
- .cursorrules Evolution
  - How to gradually improve your config
  - Using Claude to understand and modify rules

- Mental Load Optimization
  - Delegating routine complexity
  - Examples of tasks to offload
  - When to use Claude vs. when to think deeply

## 4. Limitations & Best Practices (2-3 minutes)
- Version Conflicts
  - Multiple documentation versions
  - Codebase-specific patterns

- Trust & Expertise
  - When to trust Claude's output
  - Importance of domain knowledge
  - Using Claude as a tool, not a replacement

## Key Takeaways
- Always include "ask any clarifying questions you need to get a solution with high confidence"
- Use Claude for routine complexity
- Maintain expertise to guide Claude effectively

## Notes
- All code examples in JavaScript/React/TypeScript
- Focus on real-world, relatable scenarios
- Keep examples concise but meaningful
- Include before/after comparisons
